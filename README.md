# Fake Age Verification

Have you noticed an increase in websites asking you for personal information in order to verify you are 18+? YouTube, Discord, Google, Spotify, Xbox, Roblox, X...

Age verification is in the horizon to become a requirement for social media, or any platform with a social aspect (chat, comment sections...) to operate.

This is a simple JS script that simulates age verification via facial age estimation technology or ID image upload. No data is actually sent anywhere, and no actual age verification is performed.

# Features
- A simple to use popup
- Face detection (optional): A face has to be in frame to be able to take the picture, this is NOT age verification.
- ID Image upload: This will not check if it is a valid ID or not
- Fake processing time
- A cookie to remember if the user is verified

# How to use
Simply paste one of these two code snippets in your \<head>.

**With face detection:** Uses [face-api.js](https://github.com/justadudewhohacks/face-api.js)
```html
<script defer src="https://unpkg.com/face-api.js@0.22.2/dist/face-api.min.js"></script>
<script src="https://github.com/zzniki/fake-age-verification/releases/download/v1.0/age-verification.js"></script>
```

**Without face detection:**
```html
<script src="https://github.com/zzniki/fake-age-verification/releases/download/v1.0/age-verification.js"></script>
```

# The story

**Anonymity is an essential part of the internet, not only are laws progressing toward making identification a requirement, creating a security risk, they are also being enforced without providing any resources for compliance. All the costs of verification services will have to be paid by the service provider, thus rendering the creation of small indie websites run by one person or a handful of people inviable and unprofitable.**

As said in [this reddit discussion](https://www.reddit.com/r/webdev/comments/1mhiw6c/theyre_destroying_the_internet_in_real_time_there):

"Every country seems to be passing the same law, all at once. And with a near 100% majority in their congress. This is clearly coordinated.

The fines for non-compliance are astronomical, like $20 million dollars, with no exceptions for small websites. Punishment for non-compliance includes jailing the owners of websites.

The age verification APIs are not free. It makes running a website significantly more expensive than the cost of a VPS.

"Social Media" is defined so broadly that any forum or even a comment section is "social media" and requires age verification.

"Adult Content" is defined so broadly it includes thoughts and opinions that have nothing to do with sexuality. Talking about world politics is "adult content". Talking about economic conditions is "adult content".

No one will be able to operate a website anymore unless they have a legal team, criminal defense indemnity for the owners, AI bots doing overzealous moderation, and millions of dollars for all of the compliance tools they need to run, not to mention the insurance they would need to carry to cover the inevitable data breach when the verification provider leaks everyone's faces and driver's licenses.

This will end all independent websites and online communities. This will end most hosting companies. Only fortune 500's will have websites. This will reduce web developer jobs to only a few mega corps."
